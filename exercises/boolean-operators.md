The following exercises might be a bit dry, but the concept you'll be practising is quite important in the daily life of a programmer. So bear with it, there are more interesting exercises to come! ;)

1.  Imagine the `condition` is part of your code, like this:
    
    ```ruby
    if condition
      puts "A"
    else
      puts "B"
    end
    ```

    Also, the following variables are given:

    ```ruby
    list = [2, 3, 4]
    title = "Ruby Monstas"
    ```
    Analyse the following conditions and note their return value, like in the first row. Also write down what the code would execute in the if statement above.

    Fill this out without programming anything. Just think it through in your head. After that, you can check your answers with IRB.

    condition | result (return value) | puts ...
    --------- | --------------------- | --------
    `1 < 2` | `true` | A
    `title.include?("Ruby")`||
    `list.length == 3`||
    `"test" == 1`||
    `true || false`||
    `true && false`||
    `1 < 2 || 1 > 2`||
    `list.length > 3 && title.length == 12`||
    `!(list.length == 3)`||
    `!(list[1] == 3 || 10 != 12)`||
    `1 == 1 && (!("testing" == 1 || 1 == 0))`||
    `3 != 4 && !("A" != "a" || "Ruby" == "Ruby")`||
    

2.  Consider this boolean expression:
    
    `false && x`

    You can tell what the result will be without knowing the value of `x`. Why?

3.  Imagine you are developing an application that controls a cat door. There are 3 cats that you need to accommodate, Alpha, Bravo and Charlie.

    a) Alpha is hurt and therefore shouldn't leave the house at the moment. Complete the following code so that Alpha can't leave the house:

    ```ruby
    def can_alpha_open_door?
      # your code goes here
    end
    ```

    b) Bravo likes to run away and sometimes does not come back for days if he is out between 20:00 and 06:00. Therefore, we want to lock the door to him if it's this late. Otherwise he can leave the house.

    ```ruby
    def can_bravo_open_door?(hour_of_day)
      # your code goes here
    end
    ```

    c) Charlie is a bit more complicated. Charlie should only be allowed out if both Alpha is inside (since they don't get along), and if Bravo is already inside (because they like to chase each other). Complete the following code to let Charlie out just if the two other cats are already inside:

    ```ruby
    def can_charlie_open_door?(is_alpha_inside, is_bravo_inside)
      # your code goes here
    end
    ```

    d) Another rule the system needs to work with is the holiday/winter mode. In case it is winter or the owners are on holidays, no cats are allowed to go outside.
    
    ```ruby 
    def is_any_cat_allowed_to_go_outside?(owners_are_on_holidays, season)
      # your code goes here
    end
    ```

    e) Bonus: Safety Mode. In some cases, we need to lock the door for all cats when the outside temperature is too low (below 5Â°C). Complete the code for checking if the door should be locked for all cats.

    ```ruby
    def is_door_locked_for_all?(temperature)
      # your code goes here
    end
    ```

4.  The following is a so-called _truth table_. For more examples of truth tables, refer to this session's cheat sheet.

    We have two variables called `one` and `two`. These are the input of our truth table. The third column contains the output of our truth table. E.g. for the inputs `one = true` and `two = false`, the expression results in `true`.

    Input `one` | Input `two` | Output
    ----------- | ----------- | ------
    `false` | `false` | `false`
    `true` | `false` | `true`
    `false` | `true` | `true`
    `true` | `true` | `false`

    1.  How would you describe the output of this truth table with words? When is it `true` and when is it `false`?

    2.  (BONUS) Find a formula that satisfies **all 4 rules and outputs** from the table above. You are only allowed to use these elements:

        * `one`
        * `two`
        * `&&`
        * `||`
        * `!`
        * parentheses: `()`

        For example: `!one || two`

        Hint: **All** listed elements are required to solve this puzzle!

        You can use the following snippet of code to test your formula:
        ```ruby
        boolean_inputs = [
          [false, false],
          [true, false],
          [false, true],
          [true, true]
        ]
        
        expected_outputs = [
          false,
          true,
          true,
          false
        ]
        
        def mystery_formula(one, two)
          # TODO: replace the following line with your formula!
          one
        end
        
        boolean_inputs.zip(expected_outputs).each do |(one, two), expected_output|
          print "We expected mystery_formula(#{one}, #{two}) to return #{expected_output}, "
          actual_output = mystery_formula(one, two)
          if actual_output == expected_output
            puts 'and it dit! ðŸŽ‰'
          else
            puts "but it returned #{actual_output}. ðŸ˜•"
          end
        end
        ```
