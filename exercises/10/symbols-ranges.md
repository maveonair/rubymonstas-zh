### Symbols

We are going to make a dictionary for whatever two languages you know. The key is always a word or expression in the source language, whereas the value is a word or expression in the target language.

1. Create a new file in your directory

2. Create an empty hash

3. Add at least seven key and value pairs: They key should be a symbol and the value a string­

    e.g. The German translation for `:ruby` is `"Rubin"`

4. Access the value of a certain key

5. Check if a certain value is in your hash. Try with one value that is in the hash and with another that is not

6. Delete one key-­value pair from your hash

7. Find the key for a certain value

8. Find the keys for all values which start with certain characters, e.g. `A`, `Ba`, `Rub`

### Ranges

1. Create a new file in your directory

2. Create a range with the numbers from 1 to 40, without actually using the number 40 in your code

3. Using a range method, find out what the first and the last item in the range is

4. Check if the range includes the number 44

5. Check the Ruby documentation for a method that returns the number of items in the range

6. Increase all the numbers in your range by 2

7. Finally, make an array out of your range

8. Create another range with the characters `c` to `u`

9. In the Ruby documentation, search for the method to find out the minimum value of your range

10. What is the first and the last value of your range?

11. Does your range include the character `A`?

12. What can you learn from question 10?
