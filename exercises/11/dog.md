### Dog

The topic of Classes is an extensive one. Therefore we created a few exercises for you. Let's start with an easy one. You should find all help in the slides.
You saw how to create a Cat class. So let's create a Dog class.
In this exercise we are going to write a neat little math quiz game. Here's what it should do when it's all finished:

1. Create a class named 'Dog'.

2. Initialize it with the three arguments: name, number_of_dog_friends, favourite_food.

3. Test your code by create a new Dog called Sniff, with number of dog friends five
and favourite food bacon.

4. Now we want to enable some behaviour and actions. That means we need to write some methods. Let's first write a method 'bark'. After calling this method the dog should bark. Call the method on sniff and let him bark to test it.

5. We want to give the dog a toy. Make a method 'give_a_toy' and store the toys
in an array. Give sniff three different toys.

6. Create a method 'information' which will output following string: 'The dog Sniff
has 5 dog friends and 3 toys. His favourite food is bacon.'

Congrats, you made it! ;o)
