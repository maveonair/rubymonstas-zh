We are going to make a dictionary for whatever two languages you know. The key is always a word or expression in the source language, whereas the value is a word or expression in the target language.

1. Create a new file in your directory

2. Create an empty hash

3. Add at least seven key and value pairs: They key should be a symbol and the value a string­

    e.g. The German translation for `:ruby` is `"Rubin"`

4. Access the value of a certain key

5. Check if a certain value is in your hash. Try with one value that is in the hash and with another that is not

6. Delete one key-­value pair from your hash

7. Find the key for a certain value
