topic: Getting started with JSON

Since JSON is just a text document there's only little we can do for a warmup exercise.

Describe following facts as a JSON document:

> The singer **Amy Winehouse** was born on **September 14, 1983** in **Southgate**, **London**, **England**.
>
> These music genres can be associated to her singing career: **Soul**, **Rhythm and Blues** and **Jazz**.
>
> She released two albums: **Frank** (**2003**) and **Back to Black** (**2006**).
>
> She died on **July 23, 2011** in **Camden**, **London**, **England**.

In order to see if your JSON is valid you can either:

* Head over to [https://jsonlint.com/](https://jsonlint.com/) (or any other online JSON validator) and paste your text and hit "Validate JSON" to see if your syntax is correct.
* Write JSON in your code editor (VS Code, Atom, Sublime, etc) and save it as a `*.json` document. Most editors do syntax highlighting and even validations.
