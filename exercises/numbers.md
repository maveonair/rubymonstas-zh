1.  Play around with numbers and their operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)! 
    For example, calculate your age from the year you were born in.
2.  What is special about the division operator?
3.  There is another operator we haven't talked about yet. It's called "modulo" and uses the `%` character. Try this in IRB: `8 % 3`. What's the result? Can you figure out what the operator does by experimenting with the numbers? If not, no problem, just google it!
