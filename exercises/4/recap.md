1.  Write a program that asks for the user's name and outputs it like this: `Hello, Michelle!`. Hint: Use string interpolation!

2.  We're going to collect mushrooms! Imagine your writing a program to keep track of who found how many. In IRB, execute the following: `mushroom_count = { "Hana" => 7, "Thomas" => 3, "Mario" => 4 }` Now, using that variable, output the names of the participants who collected mushrooms. Use the [Ruby documentation for Hash](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Hash.html) to find a suitable method for doing this.
